It's short for vector.

Vec is a procedural, dual-axis, polar-coordinate arcade thing I've been working on since GDC 2015. It's more of a toy than a game.

Spin around, shoot things and make pretty designs.


Controls
--------
Vec is a dual-axis game. Use your left hand to control the triangle and your right hand to aim. Each hand has two weapons at its disposal.

* Dual mice (shoot with buttons)
* Gamepad (shoot with triggers and shoulders) 
* WASD+Mouse (shoot with Shift/Q/E/Space)

My favorite combo is the left side of a game controller plus a mouse. You can also hit F to enter fullscreen or Esc to quit.
